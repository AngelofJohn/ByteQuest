## Building the Bones

Day 2. The skeleton from yesterday needed flesh. Today was about turning a basic structure into something that could actually run a lesson.

---

## What Was Built

### Lesson System
The core learning interaction:
- Question display with French word
- Four multiple choice answers
- Correct/incorrect feedback
- Progress tracking through lesson

### Answer Generation
The tricky part: generating wrong answers that aren't obviously wrong.
- Pull from same category (family words get family distractors)
- Avoid duplicates
- Shuffle answer order
- Make sure correct answer is always included

### HP & Damage System
- Wrong answers deal damage (-10 HP)
- HP bar updates visually
- Death state handling (what happens at 0 HP?)
- Healing items concept established

### XP & Leveling
- XP earned from correct answers
- Level thresholds defined
- Level up detection and notification
- Stat points on level up

### Basic UI Polish
- CSS animations for feedback
- Color coding (green = correct, red = wrong)
- Progress dots showing lesson advancement
- Streak counter visual

---

## Technical Foundations

### The Lesson Flow
```
startLesson(category)
  → generateQuestions(8)
  → showQuestion(0)
  → handleAnswer(selected)
    → if correct: XP, streak++, next question
    → if wrong: damage, streak=0, show correct
  → if last question: endLesson()
  → showResults()
```

### State During Lesson
```javascript
GameState.currentLesson = {
  questions: [...],
  currentIndex: 0,
  correctCount: 0,
  streak: 0,
  maxStreak: 0,
  startTime: Date.now()
};
```

### Why 8 Questions?
Arbitrary but intentional:
- Long enough to feel substantial
- Short enough to not be exhausting
- Enough for streak building
- Can adjust later based on testing

---

## Design Decisions

### Immediate Feedback
Show correct answer immediately after wrong answer. Reasons:
- Learning happens in the moment of error
- Don't leave player guessing what was right
- Spaced repetition will bring it back later

### Streak Multiplier
Consecutive correct answers boost XP:
- 3 in a row = 1.5x
- 5 in a row = 2x
- 8 in a row = 3x (perfect lesson)

This rewards mastery, not just completion.

### No Partial Credit
Either you know it or you don't. Binary scoring because:
- Clear expectations
- No gaming the system
- Matches language reality (you either understand or you don't)

---

## Problems Encountered

### Answer Shuffling Bug
Early version sometimes put correct answer in same position every time. Players noticed the pattern. Fixed with proper Fisher-Yates shuffle.

### Vocabulary Data Structure
Initial structure was flat. Realized we needed:
- Categories (family, food, greetings)
- Difficulty tiers
- Gender information
- Article requirements

Refactored vocabulary.js to support this.

## How It Felt

[Your memories]

- What was the first lesson that actually worked end-to-end?
- Any "aha" moments about how learning should feel?
- What took longer than expected?

## End of Entry

*The game can teach now. Tomorrow: who gives the lessons?*
