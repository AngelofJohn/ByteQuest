# Dev Log #006 - Phase 1 Reflection

**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Version:** 0.4.0
**Session Type:** Milestone Reflection

---

## The Big Picture

Today marks the completion of Phase 1 of ByteQuest - a language learning RPG (launching with French). What started as an idea has become a playable vertical slice set in Dawnmere, the first zone.

## What We Built

### Core Systems (Nov 28 - Dec 5)

**The Game Loop:**
- Talk to NPCs → Accept quests → Complete vocabulary/grammar lessons → Earn rewards
- Multiple choice questions with streak multipliers
- HP loss on wrong answers (stakes!)
- XP and gold economy

**Stats That Matter:**
- 7 stats that actually affect gameplay (Vitality → HP, Wisdom → XP bonus, etc.)
- Each stat has a tangible effect - no dump stats

**The Spellbook:**
- In-game grammar reference that unlocks as you progress
- Conjugation tables, article rules, gender guides
- Feels like earning knowledge, not just reading a textbook

**Resource Gathering:**
- 8 different minigame types (mining, woodcutting, fishing, etc.)
- Each has unique mechanics - timed quizzes, streak challenges, rhythm matching
- 3 tiers of vocabulary difficulty

## Technical Decisions

### Why Vanilla JS?
No frameworks. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Reasons:
- Fast iteration - no build step
- Easy to understand for future collaborators
- Portable - runs in any browser
- Forces simplicity

### File Structure
```
ByteQuest/
├── index.html          # Single page app
├── css/style.css       # All styles (~4000 lines)
├── data/               # Game content (vocabulary, quests, NPCs)
├── js/                 # System modules
│   ├── game.js         # Main game logic (~4200 lines)
│   ├── questSystem.js
│   ├── statsSystem.js
│   └── ... (12 system files)
├── docs/               # Design documents
└── devlog/             # You are here
```

### What Worked
- Separating data from logic (easy to add content)
- Modal-based UI (clean, focused interactions)
- Tooltip system (progressive disclosure)
- Tutorial system with completion tracking

### What's Messy (Tech Debt)
- game.js is too big - should split further
- Some unused variables flagged by linter
- CSS could be organized better
- No automated tests

## For Future Collaborators

If you're reading this and joining the project:

**The Goal:** Make language learning feel like an adventure, not homework.

**The Philosophy:**
- Learning should have stakes (HP loss) but not be punishing
- Progress should feel tangible (stats, unlocks, reputation)
- Reference materials should be earned and accessible (spellbook)

**Where to Start:**
1. Read `docs/SYSTEMS_DESIGN.md` for how everything connects
2. Read `docs/WORLD_BIBLE.md` for lore and tone
3. Play through Dawnmere to understand the loop
4. Check `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` for unresolved design decisions
