# Dev Log #009 - Haari Fields Zone Build-Out

**Date:** December 8, 2025
**Version:** 0.4.3
**Session Type:** Content Implementation

## What We Built

### Haari Fields - Zone 2 Foundation

Built out the second zone (level 5-10) with quests, vocabulary, grammar, and faction systems.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Seamless zone transition from Dawnmere
- Agricultural theme matches the "golden fields" setting
- Dave and Lyra serve as introduction to the Horticulturists
- Vocabulary progression: farming basics → crops/herbs → nature/weather

## Reflections

The zone build-out went smoothly because the foundation was already there from yesterday's NPC and filler quest work. Adding vocabulary in themed categories (crops → herbs → nature) creates a natural learning progression.

The faction split (haari_fields for farmers, horticulturists for Dave's secret cult) allows reputation to develop independently - players can befriend the farmers while remaining suspicious of Dave.

The -er verb additions give playtesters agricultural vocabulary that immediately applies to gameplay: "Je plante" while planting, "Je récolte" while harvesting.
