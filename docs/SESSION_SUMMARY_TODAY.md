### Content Hours Discussion

**Current state:** ~45 minutes (Dawnmere only)

**Original estimate for 5 zones:** ~6-8 hours

**User target:** Several hundred hours

**How to achieve hundreds of hours:**
- Spaced repetition (words need 5-10+ reviews each)
- Daily/weekly recurring content
- Deep mastery grind (1000+ words vs current 65)
- Procedural practice (random quizzes from word pool)
- Crafting/gathering loops
- Endgame dungeons (repeatable)
- Achievement hunting
- Multiple character playthroughs
- Seasonal events

**Math example:** 1,000 words × 10 reviews × 2 min = 333 hours from vocabulary alone

**Decision needed:** One-time purchase with all content, or ongoing updates? (Ties to monetization model - deferred)
