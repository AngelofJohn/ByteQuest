## World Overview

### The World of Turuem

Turuem is a world of two continents, where the echoes of a fractured kingdom still ripple through every village, city, and field. Once united under the banner of Verandum, the land now struggles with the aftermath of war, political manipulation, and a darkness that few dare to name.

**Geography:**
- Two main continents (names [TBD])
- The player arrives on the coast of Dawnmere
- Diverse landscapes: fertile fields, ancient cities, deserts, forests

**Current State:**
- A kingdom divided between those who remember the old ways and those who embrace the new order
- Tension between rural settlements and great cities
- Whispers of corruption spreading through the land

## History

### Timeline

| Era | Event | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Ancient Times | Founding of Lurenium | Ancient city predating current civilization |
| [TBD] | Establishment of Verandum | Kingdom unites the land |
| [TBD] | Reign of King Dran | Period of stability and prosperity |
| [TBD] | Birth of Hermeau and Layne | The two princes grow apart |
| The War | The Corruption attacks | Farmlands devastated, king assassinated |
| Post-War | Hermeau takes the throne | Layne exiled, propaganda spreads |
| Present Day | Player arrives in Dawnmere | Story begins |

### The Kingdom of Verandum

The kingdom of Verandum once stood as a beacon of unity across the land. Under King Dran's rule, cities flourished, farmlands produced abundant harvests, and the various regions—despite their different lifestyles—worked toward common prosperity.

The kingdom's strength lay in its diversity:
- Great cities with grand architecture and centers of learning
- Fertile farmlands feeding the population
- Trade routes connecting distant settlements
- A unified currency and language binding all together

**The Royal Bloodline:**
King Dran maintained the ancient family code, ensuring stability through legitimate succession. His two sons, Hermeau and Layne, were raised to eventually share the burden of rule—but as they grew older, they grew apart.

### The War and The Corruption

[TBD: Specific details about what "The Corruption" is]

An evil threat—known as The Corruption—plagued the lands. The farmlands bore the brunt of destruction, crops withering and communities scattering. In the chaos, King Dran was assassinated.

The official story claims enemy forces attacked from outside. The truth is far darker.

Neighboring kingdoms provided aid, sending food reserves to the failing regions. But this generosity came with strings attached, and the balance of power shifted forever.

---

## The Two Lores

One of ByteQuest's central mysteries is the gap between what people believe happened and what actually occurred.

### Established Lore (What People Believe)

> *"The world was united under the same kingdom, there were divides in lifestyle but always towards the same cause. The kingdom of Verandum stood strong in its cities, farmland, and towns in between.*
>
> *The economy was stable for many citizens as the many kingdoms had different resources to trade within themselves. The king himself was successful in maintaining the bloodline of royalty alive and honored the family code to keep stability under his reign.*
>
> *His two sons, Hermeau and Layne, grew apart as they grew older. As the father grew old in age, the assumed line went to Hermeau. An evil threat plagued the lands and with the king being assassinated, the kingdom was in danger of falling apart.*
>
> *The evil forces attacked the farmlands the hardest and destroyed mostly what had been growing. Neighboring kingdoms aided with food reserves to protect the failing regions. Hermeau took control after the war-torn lands were under plenty of disarray.*
>
> *The son grew to fit the seat of the throne to become the next heroic ruler. The second son was pushed to exile. All of the farmlands became quieter and continued with their lives. Everyone became happier and more safe after the war."*

This is the story told in schools, proclaimed in cities, and accepted by most citizens. It paints Hermeau as a hero who saved the kingdom in its darkest hour.

### Actual Lore (The Hidden Truth)

The reality is far more sinister:

- **Hermeau orchestrated the war** to seize power from his father
- **Dark magic** was used on a large scale for the first time in recorded history
- **The Corruption was not an external enemy** but a tool wielded by Hermeau's forces
- **Propaganda has rewritten history** to hide the truth
- **Layne was not exiled for weakness** but because he knew too much
- **The churches have been compromised** — Hermeau wears their colors but practices dark magic in secret

The player, as an outsider, will gradually uncover these truths through:
- Conversations with NPCs who remember the old days
- Ancient documents and relics
- Contradictions in official stories
- The testimony of those in hiding

---

## Magic System

### Overview

Magic in Turuem is **finite** — it does not expand without specific rules being followed. There are two fundamental forces:

| Force | Nature | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **The Light** | Healing, protection, truth | Publicly worshipped |
| **The Dark** | Corruption, manipulation, destruction | Hidden, forbidden |

### The Light

- Worshipped openly through temples and churches across the land
- Powers of healing, blessing, and protection
- Practiced by priests and devoted followers
- Source: [TBD - Divine origin? Natural force?]

**Light Magic Abilities:**
- [TBD: Specific spells/abilities]

### The Dark

- Not acknowledged to exist by official sources
- Hidden under "the fog of war" during the conflict
- Hermeau's army was the first to use it on a large scale in recorded history
- Source: [TBD]

**Dark Magic Abilities:**
- [TBD: Specific spells/abilities]
- Corruption of land and people
- [TBD: Other effects]

### Magic Users

[TBD: Who can use magic? Is it innate? Learned? Granted by the divine?]

---

## Religion & The Churches

### The Faith of the Light

Temples exist throughout Turuem dedicated to the propagators of the Light. The faith teaches:
- [TBD: Core tenets and beliefs]
- [TBD: Creation mythology]
- [TBD: Afterlife beliefs]

### The Two Orders

The faith has divided into two major orders with different interpretations of the Light's teachings.

#### Order of the Dawn

**Status:** Underground/scattered  
**Philosophy:** Humility, service, community  
**Focus:** Helping the poor, healing, truth-seeking  
**Location:** Villages, hidden chapels, roads, among common people

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Approach** | Works among the people |
| **View of Hermeau** | Suspicious, sees hypocrisy |
| **Strengths** | Compassion, flexibility, closer to truth |
| **Weaknesses** | Scattered, under-resourced, hunted |

**Core Beliefs:**
- Faith is lived through service, not ritual
- Anyone can be called by the Light
- Dark magic is absolute evil, no exceptions
- The poor and suffering are the priority
- Some traditions have been corrupted over time
- Truth must be uncovered, even when dangerous

**Risks of Extremism:**
- Becoming self-righteous
- Rejecting all authority (chaos)
- Seeing enemies everywhere

**Key NPCs:** [TBD]

**Reputation Ranks:**

| Rank | Threshold | Benefits |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Unknown | 0 | No recognition |
| Seeker | 100 | Access to basic healing |
| Faithful | 500 | Blessing buffs, hidden lore hints |
| Devoted | 1000 | "Lightbearer" title |
| Exalted | 2000 | Special Light-themed equipment |

---

#### The See of Lurenium

**Status:** Official church institution  
**Philosophy:** Purity, tradition, structure  
**Focus:** Preserving doctrine, rituals, maintaining order  
**Location:** Cathedrals, cities, the royal court

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Approach** | Works within institutions |
| **View of Hermeau** | Pragmatic, works with power, respects the office |
| **Strengths** | Stability, resources, influence |
| **Weaknesses** | Rigid, potentially compromised, distant from common folk |

**Core Beliefs:**
- Order and structure reflect divine will
- Only trained clergy should lead
- Sacred traditions are unchanging
- Some truths are too dangerous for common people
- Stability serves the greater good
- The anointed king deserves respect, regardless of character

**Risks of Extremism:**
- Compromising with evil for stability
- Valuing institution over people
- Becoming Hermeau's unwitting (or willing) tool

**Key NPCs:** [TBD]

**Reputation Ranks:**

| Rank | Threshold | Benefits |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Unknown | 0 | No recognition |
| Congregant | 100 | Access to cathedral services |
| Parishioner | 500 | Formal blessings, church resources |
| Deacon | 1000 | "Consecrated" title |
| Anointed | 2000 | Special ceremonial equipment |

---

### Theological Tensions Between Orders

| Issue | Order of the Dawn | The See of Lurenium |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Who can lead?** | Anyone called by the Light | Only trained clergy |
| **Dark magic** | Absolute evil, no exceptions | Perhaps... controllable? |
| **The poor** | Priority to serve | Will be saved through order |
| **Old traditions** | Some corrupted over time | Sacred and unchanging |
| **Hermeau** | False believer, hypocrite | Anointed king, respect the office |
| **Hidden truths** | Must be uncovered | Some truths are dangerous |

**Neither is Fully Right:** Both orders hold pieces of the truth, and both carry risks of going too far in their convictions.

---

### Player Relationship with Orders

| Player Choice | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|
| Side with Dawn | More access to hidden truth, but hunted by authorities |
| Side with See | Stability, resources, but moral compromises |
| Balance both | Harder path, but fullest picture of the truth |
| Reject both | Secular path, miss religious content |

**Can Both Be Maxed?** [TBD - or does raising one lower the other?]

---

### Hermeau and the Church

King Hermeau presents himself as a faithful servant of the Light:
- He wears the colors of the churches
- He makes public proclamations of faith
- He claims divine right to rule

**The Contradiction:**
- He never actually visits churches
- He does not communicate with religious leaders
- He secretly practices dark magic

This hypocrisy is known to some but spoken of by few. The See of Lurenium officially supports him; the Order of the Dawn does not.

---

## Themes & Narrative Arcs

### Core Themes

#### 1. Community & Identity

*Who are we as a people, and what binds us together?*

- Some towns see themselves as part of a larger empire, embracing shared language and culture
- Others view this as erasure of their unique identity
- The player navigates between communities with different worldviews

**Player Choices:**
- Help a province declare independence?
- Convince them to stay united for stability?

**Example Locations:**
- Imperial City: Center of civilization, promoting universal culture
- Outer Provinces: Keeping their own dialects and governance

---

#### 2. Purity of Ideals

*Should we preserve tradition or embrace change?*

- Some groups believe in the "purity" of their beliefs, rejecting outside influence
- Others argue that diversity and adaptation are strengths
- Factions represent both extremes

**Example:**
- **Vallmere** [TBD]: Forbids "foreign words," claiming they corrupt culture
- **Guild of Travelers** [TBD]: Believes language should evolve, borrowing from every culture

**Player Choices:**
- Challenge purity laws by introducing outside knowledge?
- Respect isolationist stances, reinforcing cultural preservation?

---

#### 3. Fragmentation vs. Unity

*Is separation liberation, or does it lead to weakness?*

- Some provinces see separation as necessary for freedom
- Others warn that division leads to chaos
- The player witnesses both successful and failed separations

**Examples:**
- A city that broke away years ago—thriving without imperial rule
- A breakaway region suffering from infighting

**Player Choices:**
- Use these examples to influence future separatist movements?
- Advocate for unity despite its costs?

---

#### 4. Truth vs. Propaganda

*What happens when history is rewritten?*

- The gap between Established Lore and Actual Lore
- NPCs who remember vs. those who only know the official story
- The player's role in uncovering and spreading truth

---
