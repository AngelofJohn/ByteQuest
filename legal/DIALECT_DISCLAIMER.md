## Our Approach to Language Variants

ByteQuest teaches language fundamentals using specific regional variants. We want to be transparent about our choices and respectful of all language communities.

---

## Important Notice

**The dialect or variant presented in ByteQuest is chosen for educational accessibility, not cultural superiority.**

We acknowledge that:

1. **All dialects are linguistically equal** - No dialect is inherently "better," "more correct," or "more proper" than another
2. **Regional variants are valid** - Whether you speak Parisian French, Québécois, Belgian French, Swiss French, or African French varieties, your language is complete and correct
3. **Our choice is practical, not political** - We selected [DIALECT/VARIANT] based on educational resource availability and learner familiarity, not cultural preference
4. **Language is living** - Dialects evolve, merge, and diversify naturally; this is healthy, not problematic

---

## Why We Start with One Variant

Learning a language is easier when you begin with consistency. We chose to teach [PRIMARY VARIANT] as a starting point because:

- Widely available learning resources for cross-reference
- Large speaker population for practice opportunities
- Common in media, aiding immersion outside the game
- Established standardized spelling conventions

**This does not mean other variants are wrong or inferior.**

---

## Unlocking Additional Dialects

When ByteQuest offers additional dialect content, we present it as:

- **"Another way to say this"** - not a correction or upgrade
- **Regional context** - explaining where this variant is common
- **Cultural enrichment** - celebrating linguistic diversity

We avoid:

- Labeling any dialect as "proper" or "standard"
- Implying one variant is more educated or sophisticated
- Treating regional speech as "slang" or "informal" versions of a "real" language

---

## Linguistic Diversity Statement

ByteQuest celebrates the rich diversity within every language. Languages are not monolithic - they are living systems shaped by geography, history, culture, and community.

**French varieties we respect equally:**
- Metropolitan French (France)
- Québécois (Quebec, Canada)
- Belgian French
- Swiss French
- African French varieties (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, DR Congo, etc.)
- Creole languages with French roots
- And all other French-speaking communities worldwide

**For future languages:**
- Spanish: Castilian, Latin American varieties, Caribbean Spanish
- German: Standard German, Austrian German, Swiss German
- Italian: Standard Italian, regional varieties

---

## Educational Philosophy

Our goal is to give learners a foundation they can build upon. Once you understand the fundamentals through one variant, you'll find it easier to:

- Recognize other dialects when you encounter them
- Adapt your speech to different contexts
- Appreciate the cultural richness of language variation
- Continue learning with resources from any region

We encourage learners to explore beyond what ByteQuest teaches and to engage with native speakers from all regions.

---

## Feedback Welcome

If you feel our content inadvertently:

- Presents one dialect as superior
- Uses language that dismisses regional variants
- Contains culturally insensitive material
- Perpetuates linguistic stereotypes

Please contact us at [EMAIL ADDRESS]. We take these concerns seriously and will review reported content.

---

## Academic References

Our approach aligns with modern linguistic principles:

- **Descriptive vs Prescriptive Linguistics** - We describe how language is used, not prescribe how it "should" be used
- **Sociolinguistic Awareness** - We acknowledge the social dimensions of language variation
- **UNESCO Language Principles** - All languages and dialects have intrinsic value

---

## Summary

**ByteQuest teaches [PRIMARY VARIANT] as an accessible starting point, not as the "correct" form of the language.**

We respect all speakers of all variants. Our educational choice reflects practicality, not hierarchy. We encourage learners to explore the full richness of their target language, including dialects and regional varieties not covered in our curriculum.
